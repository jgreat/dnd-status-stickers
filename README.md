### Printing Tips
These stickers are set up to print on Avery 5408 3/4" labels.

Open the xcf files in gimp, in Print -> Image Setting, check Ignore Page Margins.

Printing _exactly_ on the circles can be problematic. Every page feeds a lttle bit differently due to mechanical play in your printer. I've offset these files a little bit up and to the left for my printer, YMMV.

### SVG
Individual sticker svg's were created in Inkspace on Ubuntu Linux. I had trouble displaying the fonts in other programs.
